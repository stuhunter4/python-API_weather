# python-api-weather
<p>Seeking to utilize Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer questions about how the weather might change as one approaches the equator.</p>
<p><strong>WeatherPy.ipynb: </strong>Python script created to visualize the weather of 643 randomly selected cities across the world of varying distance from the equator; accomplished using data from the OpenWeatherMapAPI to create a representative model of weather across world cities.  Scatter plots of relationships, linear regression plots, and analysis in this notebook, and online here: https://stuhunter4.github.io/python-api-challenge/WeatherPy/WeatherPy.html</p>
<p><strong>VacationPy.ipynb: </strong>The second part of this challenge used a CSV file created in WeatherPy.ipynb, jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API.  The final product of this is a heat map that displays humidity for each of the 643 cities.  API requests determined the first hotel within 5000 meters in cities that fall display ideal weather conditions, defined as having a max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70, wind speed less than 10 mph, and zero cloudiness.  This heatmap can be found under /output_data/Humidity_HeatMap.png</p>
